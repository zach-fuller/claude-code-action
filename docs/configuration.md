# Advanced Configuration

## Using Custom MCP Configuration

The `mcp_config` input allows you to add custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to extend Claude's capabilities. These servers merge with the built-in GitHub MCP servers.

### Basic Example: Adding a Sequential Thinking Server

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    mcp_config: |
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "sequential-thinking": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
              "-y",
              "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    allowed_tools: "mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking" # Important: Each MCP tool from your server must be listed here, comma-separated
    # ... other inputs
```

### Passing Secrets to MCP Servers

For MCP servers that require sensitive information like API keys or tokens, use GitHub Secrets in the environment variables:

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    mcp_config: |
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "custom-api-server": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@example/api-server"],
            "env": {
              "API_KEY": "${{ secrets.CUSTOM_API_KEY }}",
              "BASE_URL": "https://api.example.com"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    # ... other inputs
```

### Using Python MCP Servers with uv

For Python-based MCP servers managed with `uv`, you need to specify the directory containing your server:

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    mcp_config: |
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "my-python-server": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
              "--directory",
              "${{ github.workspace }}/path/to/server/",
              "run",
              "server_file.py"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    allowed_tools: "my-python-server__<tool_name>" # Replace <tool_name> with your server's tool names
    # ... other inputs
```

For example, if your Python MCP server is at `mcp_servers/weather.py`, you would use:

```yaml
"args":
  ["--directory", "${{ github.workspace }}/mcp_servers/", "run", "weather.py"]
```

**Important**:

- Always use GitHub Secrets (`${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`) for sensitive values like API keys, tokens, or passwords. Never hardcode secrets directly in the workflow file.
- Your custom servers will override any built-in servers with the same name.

## Additional Permissions for CI/CD Integration

The `additional_permissions` input allows Claude to access GitHub Actions workflow information when you grant the necessary permissions. This is particularly useful for analyzing CI/CD failures and debugging workflow issues.

### Enabling GitHub Actions Access

To allow Claude to view workflow run results, job logs, and CI status:

1. **Grant the necessary permission to your GitHub token**:

   - When using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, add the `actions: read` permission to your workflow:

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: write
     pull-requests: write
     issues: write
     actions: read # Add this line
   ```

2. **Configure the action with additional permissions**:

   ```yaml
   - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
     with:
       anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
       additional_permissions: |
         actions: read
       # ... other inputs
   ```

3. **Claude will automatically get access to CI/CD tools**:
   When you enable `actions: read`, Claude can use the following MCP tools:
   - `mcp__github_ci__get_ci_status` - View workflow run statuses
   - `mcp__github_ci__get_workflow_run_details` - Get detailed workflow information
   - `mcp__github_ci__download_job_log` - Download and analyze job logs

### Example: Debugging Failed CI Runs

```yaml
name: Claude CI Helper
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
  actions: read # Required for CI access

jobs:
  claude-ci-helper:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          additional_permissions: |
            actions: read
          # Now Claude can respond to "@claude why did the CI fail?"
```

**Important Notes**:

- The GitHub token must have the `actions: read` permission in your workflow
- If the permission is missing, Claude will warn you and suggest adding it
- Currently, only `actions: read` is supported, but the format allows for future extensions

## Custom Environment Variables

You can pass custom environment variables to Claude Code execution using the `claude_env` input. This is useful for CI/test setups that require specific environment variables:

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    claude_env: |
      NODE_ENV: test
      CI: true
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://test:test@localhost:5432/test_db
    # ... other inputs
```

The `claude_env` input accepts YAML format where each line defines a key-value pair. These environment variables will be available to Claude Code during execution, allowing it to run tests, build processes, or other commands that depend on specific environment configurations.

## Limiting Conversation Turns

You can use the `max_turns` parameter to limit the number of back-and-forth exchanges Claude can have during task execution. This is useful for:

- Controlling costs by preventing runaway conversations
- Setting time boundaries for automated workflows
- Ensuring predictable behavior in CI/CD pipelines

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    max_turns: "5" # Limit to 5 conversation turns
    # ... other inputs
```

When the turn limit is reached, Claude will stop execution gracefully. Choose a value that gives Claude enough turns to complete typical tasks while preventing excessive usage.

## Custom Tools

By default, Claude only has access to:

- File operations (reading, committing, editing files, read-only git commands)
- Comment management (creating/updating comments)
- Basic GitHub operations

Claude does **not** have access to execute arbitrary Bash commands by default. If you want Claude to run specific commands (e.g., npm install, npm test), you must explicitly allow them using the `allowed_tools` configuration:

**Note**: If your repository has a `.mcp.json` file in the root directory, Claude will automatically detect and use the MCP server tools defined there. However, these tools still need to be explicitly allowed via the `allowed_tools` configuration.

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    allowed_tools: |
      Bash(npm install)
      Bash(npm run test)
      Edit
      Replace
      NotebookEditCell
    disallowed_tools: |
      TaskOutput
      KillTask
    # ... other inputs
```

**Note**: The base GitHub tools are always included. Use `allowed_tools` to add additional tools (including specific Bash commands), and `disallowed_tools` to prevent specific tools from being used.

## Custom Model

Use a specific Claude model:

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    # model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"  # Optional: specify a different model
    # ... other inputs
```

## Claude Code Settings

You can provide Claude Code settings to customize behavior such as model selection, environment variables, permissions, and hooks. Settings can be provided either as a JSON string or a path to a settings file.

### Option 1: Settings File

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    settings: "path/to/settings.json"
    # ... other inputs
```

### Option 2: Inline Settings

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    settings: |
      {
        "model": "claude-opus-4-20250514",
        "env": {
          "DEBUG": "true",
          "API_URL": "https://api.example.com"
        },
        "permissions": {
          "allow": ["Bash", "Read"],
          "deny": ["WebFetch"]
        },
        "hooks": {
          "PreToolUse": [{
            "matcher": "Bash",
            "hooks": [{
              "type": "command",
              "command": "echo Running bash command..."
            }]
          }]
        }
      }
    # ... other inputs
```

The settings support all Claude Code settings options including:

- `model`: Override the default model
- `env`: Environment variables for the session
- `permissions`: Tool usage permissions
- `hooks`: Pre/post tool execution hooks
- And more...

For a complete list of available settings and their descriptions, see the [Claude Code settings documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings).

**Notes**:

- The `enableAllProjectMcpServers` setting is always set to `true` by this action to ensure MCP servers work correctly.
- If both the `model` input parameter and a `model` in settings are provided, the `model` input parameter takes precedence.
- The `allowed_tools` and `disallowed_tools` input parameters take precedence over `permissions` in settings.
- In a future version, we may deprecate individual input parameters in favor of using the settings file for all configuration.
